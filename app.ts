function make_shirt(size : string = "large", message: string = "I love typeScript" ){
    console.log(`Making a ${size} t-shirt with the message "${message}" printed on it.`)
}
make_shirt();
make_shirt("medium");
make_shirt("small", "Dive into coding");

function describe_city(city:string, country: string = "Pakistan") {
    console.log(`${city} is in ${country}.`)
}

describe_city("Karachi");
describe_city("Hyderabad");
describe_city("Kabul", "Afghanistan");



//Q39. City Names: Write a function called city_country() that takes in the name of a city and its country. The function should return a string formatted like this:
//"Lahore, Pakistan"

function city_country(city:string, country: string): string {
    return `"${city}, ${country}"`;
